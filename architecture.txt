#Document Summarization Architecture (AWS + GenAI)
1. User uploads a document.
2. The document is stored in Amazon S3.
3. An S3 event triggers an AWS Lambda function.
4. Lambda reads the document and checks its size.
5. If the document is large, Lambda splits it into chunks.
6. Each chunk is sent to a GenAI model (Amazon Bedrock).
7. The model generates summaries for each chunk.
8. Lambda combines all summaries into a final summary.
9. The final summary is stored in S3 or returned to the user.
